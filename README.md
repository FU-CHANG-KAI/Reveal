(sub plot)
(1)In Asia, we can observe that life expectancy expoentially increeases with the growth of GDP. 
(2)In Americas and Europe, life expectancy expoentially increeases with the growth of GDP anf then begin to linearly grow up. 
(3)But in africa, even GDP per capita is in the same level, there are big differences between life expectancies.


Accoring to box plot, GDP per capita is extremely low and almost all people living in such poverty condition.
